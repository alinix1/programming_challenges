import random


def guess_number(n):
    '''
    User must guess a randomly generated number out of n tries. If they guessed
    incorrectly but still have remaining guesses, the program should print
    whether the random number is higher or lower than their guess and continue
    through the game.

    Input
        n: INT - number of guesses the user is allowed
    '''
    pass


def fizz_buzz(n):
    '''
    Write a short program that returns a list of numbers/strings from 1 to n.
    For each multiple of 3, substitute in "Fizz" instead of the number. For
    each multiple of 5, add in "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which
    are multiples of both 3 and 5, use "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

    Input
        n: INT - max number (inclusive)
    Output
        a list of integers and strings
        e.g. [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz']
    '''
    pass


def find_prime(n):
    '''
    Return a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to n

    Input
        n: INT - max number (inclusive)
    Output
        a list of primes
    '''
    pass


def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    '''
    Compute the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence. The sequence should start
    with 1, not 0.

    Input
        n: INT - the nth term
    Output
        an integer
    '''
    pass
